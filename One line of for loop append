greeting = 'Hello World'
mylist = []

for letter in mylist:
  mylist.append(greeting)
mylist

##Let's make it in one line:

mylist = [letter for letter in greeting]
mylist

##With numbers

mylist = [num for num in range(0,12)]
mylist

#if you want even numbers
mylist = [num for num in range(0,12) if num % 2 == 0]
mylist
#square of result
mylist = [num**2 for num in range(0,12) if num % 2 == 0]
mylist


###Little Project

celcius = [0,10,22,34.5]
fahrenheit = [((9/5) * temp + 32) for temp in celcius]
fahrenheit

#It is same as:

fahrenheit = []

for temp in celcius:
  fahrenheit.append(((9/5) * temp + 32))
fahrenheit


###NOTE: Coding is all about readability and simplication. Making things in one line does not mean it is a good code.
